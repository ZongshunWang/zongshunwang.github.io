About Me
===
Hi! I am Zongshun Wang (Chinese: 王宗顺), currently pursuing my PhD degree (Supervisor: Asso. Prof. Yuping Shen) at Institute of Logic and Cognition, Department of Philosophy, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou.

Research Intereset
---
My research interest lies in formal argumentation theory, which serves as a computational model for evaluating arguments in conflict situations. Within this field, my focus is on the study of argumentation semantics, particularly in broadening the evaluation scales for argument strength in quantitative argumentation.
